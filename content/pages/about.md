I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UCL, and am part of the Foundational AI Centre for Doctoral Training. I am supervised by Dr. Iasonas Kokkinos, and my research is largely focused on Multi-Task Learning in Computer Vision. I also work as a Computer Vision Scientist at Ariel AI, working on new methods for 3D Human Modelling. 

Prior to my PhD, I completed a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Data Science and Machine Learning and UCL, where I received a distinction grade. My research involved applying budgeted architectural search to multi-task models for dense prediction tasks - this project was also under the supervision of Dr. Kokkinos.
